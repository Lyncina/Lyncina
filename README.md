- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Lyncina
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in video games, rollerblading, weight lifting, drawing
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently reviewing HTML and CSS courses, before I attempt to learn JavaScript again. JS is one of the reasons I put my coding lessons on hold for a while, I picked up HTML and CSS very easily, but JS proved to be an entirely different beast.
